                <span class="contsubhd"><h3>1. Clothes:</h3></span>
                
                <p>Your catgirl will require basic clothing. Nothing too fancy 
                at first is required. It is likely that the shelter or 
                breeder you received her from only had had her wear basic 
                t-shirts and pants/shorts. Almost any brand will do as long 
                as they are cotton or natural fiber; 
                <strong>catgirls have delicate skin</strong>. 
                Undergarments are at your discretion. Let your catgirl 
                smell and mark (indicated by her rubbing her cheek against 
                them) the new clothing after you have handled the new 
                clothing and rubbed them on your face before attempting to 
                dress her in them. It's very important that she recognises 
                these clothes as gifts from her master (your odor) and are 
                thus now hers (her odor). Nicer, flashier clothing can be 
                purchased later once your catgirl settles into her new 
                home, if you intend to show or breed her. Ferals and 
                strays instinctively will wear whatever clothing they 
                can scavenge, which is why it's imperative that you get 
                such catgirls their own clothing in accordance with the 
                previously mentioned guidelines so that she will bond 
                with you more quickly as her provider and caretaker. Be 
                sure to undress a feral/stray with care when presenting 
                her with new clothing. Her old clothes are a symbol of 
                her old unbonded life and should be disposed of out of 
                her sight.<br>
                Shoes are optional and should not be forced. Shoes should 
                still be required when the temperature reaches near freezing, 
                if traveling outdoors.</p>

            <content id="litter">
                <span class="contsubhd"><h3>2. Litter Box Logic:</h3></span>
                
                <p>Many catgirls are initially raised to use litter pans for 
                elimination. By the time they are sexually mature a good 
                breeder will typically have them toilet trained and you will 
                only have to show her the basic functions of flushing and 
                the location of sanitary cleaning materials. However, if 
                your catgirl is a stray/feral from a shelter it's possible 
                she was never fully toilet trained. This matter is fairly 
                easily rectified in a few ways. When your catgirl evinces 
                signs of elimination (squatting-straining) calmly and 
                carefully pick her up under the arms and place her on the 
                toilet. Gently hold her there until she eliminates. 
                Demonstrate proper sanitary wiping upon completion. 
                Your catgirl is a sanitary and fastidious creature. 
                She will very quickly grasp the mechanics of clean and 
                safe elimination on the toilet and be much happier for it, 
                as will you.</p>
                
                <p>Unfortunately, some catgirls have never been toilet 
                trained or even spent much time indoors. This is especially 
                true of strays and ferals. Additional time and patience is 
                required to achieve the desired result. If your catgirl 
                will not permit you to pick her up to move to the toilet, 
                when she eviences elimination it will be necessary to 
                gradually shape her behavior. Be aware this may take 
                anywhere from a few days to a week or more. When she 
                evinces elimination quickly and calmly place a 
                CatGirlz!-brand floor nappy underneath her.<br>
                She qill quickly equate the nappy with the spot of 
                elimination. Again, catgirls are neat and clean creatures 
                about elimination. Now move the floor nappy closer to the 
                bathroom each time, until the nappy is finally in front of 
                the toilet. Then finally place the nappy over the toilet 
                bowl. She will quickly grasp your implications. Be sure to 
                use soothing and calm words during this procedure and 
                praise her effectively when she eliminates on the proper 
                instrument. Catgirls, even strays and ferals, are quick to 
                respond to positive reinforcement.</p>
                
                <p>You may still have the occasional "accident" no matter 
                how well-trained your catgirl is. Be gentle with her. If 
                she is well trained an "accident" is more embarassing and 
                unsightly to her than it is to you.</p>

                <span class="contsubhd"><h3>3. Feeding Facts</h3></span>
                
                <p>Your new catgirl has particular dietary concerns. A proper 
                diet will ensure a fit, active and healthy companion for many 
                years. A poor diet can result in an overweight, lethargic 
                catgirl with serious health issues.</p>
                
                <p>Your catgirl is bred to be specifically compatible 
                with most human food. However, particular care must be given 
                to avoid certain types of food except for occasional treats.</p>
                <p>A proper diet consists of a large amount of daily 
                protein intake to keep her happy and active.</p>
                
                <p>We suggest:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>50% low-fat meats, chicken, fish and beef. She can eat 
                        them raw or cooked. It is suggested that the majority of her 
                        meat should be cooked to avoid possible intestinal parasites 
                        and to keep her breath smelling acceptable. 
                        <strong>Kitty-Klean mouthwash is highly recommended 
                        in any event</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                
                    <li>
                        <p>40% fresh vegetables and fruits. Your catgirl should 
                        immediately express an interest in fresh greenery. Encourage 
                        this. A catgirl eating plenty of greens is cute to watch and 
                        ensures that she has a healthy digestive tract. IF your 
                        catgirl is reluctant to et fruits and vegetables, encourage 
                        her with the application of Krazy-Kat protein spray on them, 
                        which they should find delicious!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>8% grains. Catgirls enjoy occasional grains such as rice, 
                        barley and the like. Be careful with these! They can make 
                        her feel unpleasantly bloated!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>2% or less sugary snacks. Your catgirl will love sugary 
                        snacks. Bear in mind, however, that 
                        <strong>they are NOT good for her!</strong> Sugar will give 
                        her energy and taste delicious, but provides <b>no</b> 
                        nutrition. Therefore, it's strongly recommended to save 
                        sugary snacks for special occasions.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Alcohol should <strong>never</strong> be given to your 
                catgirl. It's metabolized in them in a similiar fashion to 
                humans, but an amount that would get an average person 
                "buzzed" will likely have them passed out. Fortunately, the 
                smell of liquor is generally reviled by most breeds and, as 
                such, can be used on objects to discourage the catgirl's 
                interest in them.</p>
                
                <p>If your catgirl begins to develop a belly, you should 
                first cut back on sweets and attempt more vigorous excercise 
                routines and longer playtime with her. If your catgirl is 
                from a less-active breed you can control her weight by 
                reducing the meal portion sizes and breaking them up over 
                a period of time during the course of a day. It is important 
                to keep your catgirl on a schedule of feeding and to avoid 
                snacking. Do not reward her begging. <strong>We know that can 
                be darn hard, but remember, it's for her own good!</strong>
                <br>If you choose to take your meals with your catgirl at the 
                table, it is best to let her have her own bowl. Utensils may 
                not be required. Some of the more intelligent breedsare 
                instinctive mimics and derive pleasure from imitating their 
                masters with utensils. If she doesn't appear to want to use 
                or be interested in utensils do <b>NOT</b> force them on her. 
                Remember, catgirls can be quite stubborn.</p>

                <span class="contsubhd"><h3>4. Grooming and Bathing</h3></span>
                
                <p>Grooming</p>
                
                <p>Your catgirl will spend a large amount of time grooming 
                herself. Catgirls find their appearance very important and 
                find the relationship between their own look and those of 
                other catgirls very important.</p>
                
                <p>Again, breeders will generally instruct your catgirl in the 
                basic rudiments of grooming their head hair and taking care of 
                the appearance of their ears and tail. Typically in these cases 
                you will only have to provide your catgirl a mirror and basic 
                grooming items: brushes, catgirl hair oils and catgirl soaps 
                and skin conditioners.</p>
                
                <p><strong>***VERY IMPORTANT***</strong>
                <br><strong>DO NOT</strong> use human soaps and shampoos on your 
                catgirl, her skin and scalp are very delicate. Take care to ONLY 
                use <abbr title="Society for the Protection of Cat Girls Association">S.P.C.G.A.</abbr> 
                approved products. If the breeder has been using a particular 
                brand it is a good idea to stick with what your catgirl knows 
                already.</p>
                
                <p>Ferals and strays often have some difficulty with grooming, as 
                they have never been taught properly. If this is the case, wait 
                until you see your catgirl attempting to groom. This will often 
                involve an awkward attempt to either lick or run her fingers 
                through her hair. She may become a bit distressed and depressed. 
                Sit beside her and offer her a soft brush. <strong>Be sure to let 
                her smell and mark it.</strong>
                <br>This is important: Strays and ferals are very, very sensitive 
                about items not marked as "theirs and master's". By establishing 
                "her" property your stray/feral will begin to bond. The importance 
                of her accepting you as her provider and caretaker is difficult 
                to even exaggerate!
                <br>Begin gently, carefully brushingher hair from crown to back of 
                her head. Be cautious of snags and snarls especially around the 
                ears. After a few strokes your catgirl should have her eyes 
                half-closed and she should begin to purr, demonstrating her 
                pleasure and contentment. Catgirls enjoy being touched and petted 
                by a beloved caretaker as much as any -girl. <i>This simulates the 
                grooming her mother provided when she was still in her care.</i> 
                Continue until her hair is brushed out neatly and the tufts of hair 
                on her ears are lying smooth and untangled.</p>
                
                <p>Praise her during the brushing and after. Offer her the mirror to 
                see herself and praise/pet her. It won't take her long to get the 
                hang of it! She will quickly begin to groom herself if left the 
                tools once shown how. This alone should perk her up and provide 
                valuable bonding tie. Be careful not to spoil her much by doing all 
                the grooming!She may come to expect you do it every day, and you 
                might find it hard to say no!</p>
                
                <p><strong>Important!</strong>
                <br>You need to be very careful about attempting to brush your 
                catgirl's tail. Most are remarkably possessive of their tail. 
                Indeed, their tail is the pride and dignity of your catgirl. Most 
                catgirl spats and fights are started over insults and touching another 
                catgirl's tail uninvited.
                <br>They generally prefer to groom their own tails. Attempting to 
                do so without her explicit permission often ends in hissing, 
                spitting and even biting! Therefore, it's strongly recommended not 
                to go there unless invited. If you are lucky enough to have your own 
                catgirl offer you their tail to groom, you should be honoured to be 
                held in such high esteem by her. Please be certain to treat it with 
                your utmost respect.</p>
                
                <p>Bathing</p>
                
                <p>As previously entioned, your catgirl is a remarkably neat and 
                clean creature, but even that being the case, she will require 
                regular bathing. If she is a sedentary breed she may only require a 
                weekly bath. More active breeds that energetically play and sweat 
                may require almost daily bathing.
                <br><strong>Again, we cannot stress strongly enough that you use 
                <abbr title="Society for the Protection of Cat Girls Association">S.P.C.G.A.</abbr>
                -approved bathing products. Catgirls have no real body hair except 
                for the head/ears and tail. Thus their skin is vulnerable to strong 
                soaps which may cause itch and painful irritation.</strong></p>
                
                <p>A catgirl from a breeder is used to bathing. She generally will 
                have been bathed with her siblings and mother. It is highly likely 
                she will look forward to bathing. Indeed, many catgirls will 
                investigate the tub while YOU are bathing. It may be difficult to 
                dissuade her from joining you!</p>
                
                <p>Again, ferals and strays may present their own challenges. 
                Coaxing a stray/feral into the water is usually traumatizing, for 
                both the owner and catgirl!
                <br>Again, behaviour shaping often works best. Your catgirl will 
                begin to display signs of disgust, such as hissing at her 
                reflection in the mirror and demonstrating agitation with grooming 
                herself if she begins to feel unclean and dirty. But if an actual 
                tub of water is too frightening to her and you attempt to 
                force-bathe her, she may become further distressed about her 
                appearance and depressed by disobeying you.</p>
                
                <p>If this occurs you can ease her distress accordingly. Begin by 
                placing some warm water in a medium-sized bowl with some soft 
                <em>natural fiber</em> cloths. Have several soft towels for drying 
                handy. Add some catgirl soap to the warm water, wait until the 
                foam settles. <em>It is usually a good idea to do this in a room 
                without a carpet.</em> Call your catgirl to you and gently undress 
                her. Speak soothingly and sit her on a towel, wring out a washcloth 
                in the warm soapy water and again, let her smell it.</p>
                
                <p>Begin to gently wipe her neck and shoulders. She may tense up 
                initially, but continue wiping and speak calmly and gently to her. 
                Praise and pet her if needed. Make sure the cloth stays warm and 
                is not too sopping wet. Continue to wipe her torso and arms taking 
                care to get under her breasts and arms. <i>Extra care should be 
                taken with catgirl breeds with large breasts as they are very 
                sensitive to the touch even when not in season.</i> By this point 
                she should be relaxed and/or almost comatose! If she is still 
                tense, continue to wash her upper body until she relaxes while 
                speeking soothingly. Mutual trust will get you through this!</p>
                
                <p>The afromentioned catgirl soap can also be used on her hair in 
                lieu of a catgirl shampoo until she can be bathed in a proper tub. 
                Use a bit more water on the wash cloth and be sure to dampen all 
                the hair thoroughly while avoiding getting water in her ears. You 
                would only frustrate her and yourself. The soapy water can be left 
                to dry in her hair without rinsing, as there are quick-drying 
                hypoallergenic compounds in the soap. Make sure her eyes are 
                bright, clear and not bloodshot. Take the opportunity to examine 
                the insides of her ear folds for signs of irritation and wax 
                build-up that may be causing her distress. Feel the muscles of her 
                upper and lower back while washing. They should be firm and should 
                not demonstrate sensitivity. Be alert for anything that seems 
                amiss with her joints and extremities. An ounce of prevention will 
                prevent a lot of pain later. Your catgirl may know something is 
                wrong with her, but she might be unable or unwilling to describe 
                or articulate it properly.</p>
                
                <p>Continue by washing her legs and feet, checking them for 
                splinters, blisters and other injuries. Her legs should bend 
                smoothly and easily. Moving on, be sure to clean her genitals and 
                anus thoroughly. She may become agitated or uncomfortable while 
                doing so initially. Be gentle! This is a sensitive region! Continue 
                to speak soothingly and calmly until done. It is important for her 
                genitals and anus to be clean in or der to avoid irritation and 
                infections of the delicate tissues. Be sure to check for any 
                unusual rashes or signs of irritation. Most catgirls will enjoy 
                this inadvertent genital stimulation during bath time by their 
                masters even when not in season and encourage you to continue, so 
                be careful to not overdo it as it may teach her bad habits!
                <br>Continue this "dry bathing" for a week or more, until she is 
                comfortable with it. Then move the bathing spot to the bathroom by 
                the tub. Then over the next few times try "dry bathing" with her in 
                the empty tub until she willingly climbs into the tub. Next, have 
                about an inch of warm water in the tub. Then a few more inches, then 
                one time with the tap running very softly. Eventually she will 
                happily jump into a full tub with or without you! Be sure to offer 
                her the washcloth and indicate her tail. She should generally be 
                left alone to wash her own tail, unless she indicates it is alright 
                for you to do so. Remember, you are handling your catgirl's pride 
                and joy! Treat it with dignity and respect, and she'll thank you for it.</p>
                
                <p>Showers should generally be avoided as catgirls' ears can be 
                filled with water easily if the water pressure is too high, 
                causing ear-aches and possible ear infections. If your catgirl 
                insists on showering with you, coax her into wearing a waterproof 
                shower cap. Then wash her hair in the sink or tub normally. Your 
                catgirl will quickly learn how to run a bath for herself when she 
                needs one, or you can get her on a schedule to bathe with you.</p>
                
                <p>Your catgirl will learn her grooming and bathing habits from 
                YOU so be sure to do a good job!</p>
                
                <p>Help dry her <em>if desired</em> and leave her to finish her own 
                grooming with a brush unless she indicates otherwise. Some 
                catgirls will dry themselves once they know what to do and others 
                will be insistent about their master doing it. Remember, the same 
                rules about her tail apply as in grooming or bathing as to drying. 
                Bath times should be an enjoyable experiance for you both together 
                or a source of pride for her to be able to do it by herself.</p>

                <p>Your catgirl, as she settles in to her new home, will be both 
                adventurous and very cautious about exploring. Be sure your home 
                is a safe and inviting place:
                <br>    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Keep sharp objects <strong>which are usually shiny</strong> out of her reach</li>
                        <li>Make sure the household plants are "catgirl-safe", see <a href="">here</a> for more information</li>
                        <li>Keep your dirty clothes in a sealable hamper. She will likely end up finding the scent of her master intoxicating, so to keep your clothes safe keep them put up. <i>Doggirls are not alone in this behaviour</i></li>
                        <li>Ensure that she cannot get herself tangled up in power cords while you may or may not be at home</li>
                        <li>Make sure any cleaning chemicals, cooking ingredients and medicines</li>
                        <li>Ensure doors and windows are locked until you are sure she will not wander outside unless accompanied by a household member</li>

                <span class="contsubhd"><h3>6. Playtime!</h3></span>
                
                <p>Your catgirl is an inquisitive, bright and intelligent being. 
                Depending on the breed and specific breeder plans your catgirl 
                will be at least as intelligent as a 5-year-old human toddler to 
                being almost indistinguishable from a late teenage girl. These 
                descriptions are not entirely comparable as she will in either 
                case be a fully functional member of her own species regardless. 
                And, as such, they will crave stimulation and activity in levels 
                determined by breed, intelligence and personality. Luckily for 
                you, she will be distracted by almost anything. Any of the 
                Petgirlco-line of catgirl toys will keep her endlessly entertained. 
                Keep in mind the best playtime she will have will be when YOU are 
                playing with her.
                <br>She will enjoy stalking and pouncing on you if you are so 
                inclined or watching TV, or observing you in your hobbies. If 
                you allow this be SURE to correct her if she bites while 
                roughhousing. When she is done playing be sure to stop. Some 
                catgirls, usually from the more intelligent breeds, may show 
                interest in particular TV shows and even books! Teaching your 
                catgirl basic literacy is possible, again depending on your 
                patience, her breed and personality. You may find having a 
                fairly articulate and literate catgirl a bit more of a handful 
                than some owners who do not encourage this, but you will have 
                a companion who can react better in an emergency involving you 
                or her home and to say nothing of a companion you can converse 
                with!</p>
                
                <p>You should generally keep your catgirl indoors unless 
                accompanied by a household member. Many owners enjoy taking their 
                catgirl out shopping and to parks to play. This can be a bit 
                risky with other catgirls and doggirls around. If she is well 
                trained and an intelligent breed, outings may prove beneficial 
                to her advanced socialization and acquiring additional life 
                skills. It is important to keep her in-check as the outside 
                world will be full of sights, smells and other -girl animals 
                she has not experienced. The situation may be a bit daunting 
                for her at first. Try time in the yard first. Progress to short 
                trips around the neighbourhood, before leaving familiar areas. 
                Most catgirls, if coaxed and encouraged, can easily travel in 
                cars and trains even on long trips. Be sure to bring toys and 
                snacks!</p>

                <p>Catgirls will typically sleep about 10-14 hours a day. Some 
                owners claim they need so much sleep because of their 
                supercharged levels of energy for the rest of the day! She 
                will usually curl up with her master before naps. This is an 
                excellent time for bonding by petting and stroking her. She 
                will indicate her contestment by a rhytmic purring and her 
                ears laying slight back and down. She may smile and sigh and 
                snuggle against you and "kneed" her fingers in your legs. 
                Catgirls have been shown to have a therapeutic effect on 
                individuals suffering from depression and high levels of 
                stress. Depending on her age she may even attempt to nurse 
                on finger or piece of cloth! Don't be offended, this is a 
                singular honour your catgirl is paying to you unconsciously.</p>
                
                <p>It is your choice as to disposition of her sleeping 
                arrangements. Some owners have a normal human bed prepared, 
                others a small cushioned area for her to stretch out on. 
                Still, others allow their catgirl to sleep in the same bed. 
                Regardless of your choice it is important to mark her 
                sleeping space with your scent. However, your catgirl may 
                wish to make her own sleeping arrangements. Allow her to 
                explore a bit. Strays and ferals are more prone to sleep 
                alone in their home until they get used to their new life. 
                Then they usually desire the presence of their master while 
                sleeping. Catgirls rarely sleep in clothing, because 
                <em>they generally find it too constricting,</em> so be sure 
                their clean clothing is nearby for dressing when they 
                awaken. Ferals and strays are usually extremely difficult 
                to relocate from their owner's bed if they have gotten 
                used to sleeping there, be alert of this. They will 
                jealously and even violently defend their sleeping 
                privilege against doggirls and rabbitgirls and even human 
                females! So be warned if you let your catgirl share your 
                bed on a regular basis.</p>

                <p>Catgirl breeds are specifically tested and monitored to 
                ensure the maximum healthy lifespan and identify any possible 
                weaknesses in them. Your catgirl will require a visit to your 
                local Catgirl Health Care Provider within 6 months to ensure 
                that she is settling in with her master and that no lurking 
                health issues have yet to surface, then visit yearly thereafter. 
                The CHCP will give you an overall view of her health and any 
                additional advice or lifestyle/feeding changes that may be needed.
                <br>All approved breeders are carefully monitored to ensure 
                the litters produced are full of healthy, energetic and 
                intelligent kittens. Genetic screening on kittens is done in 
                the first few weeks following birth to make sure all gene 
                markers are within norms. This will ensure catgirl companions 
                that will have long and happy lives. The average life of your 
                catgirl will depend on the breed, but due to advances in 
                nanotech you can easily expect a lifelong companion!</p>
                
                <p>It is still of vital importance for owners to watch over 
                their catgirls' overall health under the guidance of an 
                accredited CHCP.
                <br><strong>Important!</strong>
                <br>If you notice sudden changes in your catgirl's temperament, 
                bowel movements, appetite and/or vomiting or diarrhea that 
                last for more than 24 hours; contact your CHCP IMMEDIATELY!</p>

                <span class="contsubhd"><h3>9. Reproductive Concerns</h3></span>
                
                <p>Your catgirl, upon sexual maturity usually in her 5-7th year, 
                will go into "season" 3-4 times a year. During this time she 
                will be sexually receptive and capable of conceiving. 
                <strong>Do not breed your catgirl unless under the strict 
                supervision of a Licenced and Accredited Breeder!</strong> 
                Registered catboys are rare and rigorously screened for genetic 
                defects; a mating with an unlicensed male can produce still 
                born offspring or worse!</p>
                
                <p>Identifying that your catgirl is in "season" or "heat" is 
                fairly easy. She will be flushed in the face. She will be 
                even more insistent for your affection, often in socially 
                awkward ways. She may even avoid you and alternate between 
                extremes of affection and anger!</p>
                
                <p>Her behaviour may envince in appropiate behaviours in front 
                of other. She may begin touching her genitals and may insist 
                you do so as well in inappropiate situations. Your catgirl 
                may "present" at you randomly (getting on all fours and 
                lifting her buttocks towards you) and even attempt to have 
                you mount her during bathing or grooming, by awkwardly pulling 
                you onto her. She may rub up inappropiately against objects 
                for sexual stimulation.</p>
                
                <p>This awkward behaviour can be handled thusly:</p>
                
                <p class="list">1.</p>
                
                <p>You may use special medication meant to relieve the effects 
                of heat. They contain a synthetic progesterone analogue to 
                suppress the ovulation cycle and a mild tranquilizer to minimise 
                the undesired behaviours. A single pill with her morning meal 
                will keep her decently calm for up to 24-32 hours. The known 
                side effects are excessive sleeping, headache, nausea and lack 
                of appetite. This is an excellent option for owners during busy 
                work periods or owners that are a bit squeamish about their 
                catgirls' breeding cycle. If drug control of your catgirl's 
                ovulation is contraindicated by current medication or an aversion 
                to synthetic hormones or if financial issues prevent purchase 
                there exist other options for the prudent owner.</p>
                
                <p class="list">2.</p>
                
                <p>The worst of your catgirl's behaviours can be mitigated with 
                daily manual stimulation during her ovulation week.
                <br>Make sure your hands are clean and/or you are wearing a 
                latex glove. When she "presents" kneel behind her and pull her 
                pants down, spreading her thighs as needed. Place one hand on 
                her back just above the tail and apply firm pressure. <em>This 
                simulates the weight of a male.</em> Take the other hand and 
                gently insert your fore finger into her vagina. The number of 
                fingers will depend upon the build of your catgirl. Given the 
                state of her agitation you may need to add an additional finger 
                or two.</p>
                
                <p>She should not require lubrication if in season. The catgirl 
                vagina was modeled closely on the human female vagina to 
                facilitate easier care. Curl the finger(s) slightly upward and 
                work them up to the last knuckle in a back-and-forth motion. 
                Start slowly and work up to a fast and firm pace. Your catgirl 
                should begin to vocalise (moan, mew, whimper, growl) and 
                tightly contract her vaginal muscles against your fingers and 
                press her hips against your hand. She will climax at least once 
                every 3-5 minutes, perhaps more. Her climax (analogous to a 
                human female's orgasm) is usually indicated by loud vocalisations, 
                rhytmic contractions of her vagina followed by slumping over, 
                ragged breathing and panting. At this point, it is usually a 
                good idea to give her a break.</p>
                
                <p>Continue finger insertion until this occurs, and then rapidly 
                and with force insert your fingers several more times and then 
                stop while pushing the tips of your fingers firmly against her 
                cervix for several seconds. (This simulates the male's orgasm.) 
                The extra force you use to simulate male climax will not injure 
                her, as a male's penis is knobby and covered with nurled spines, 
                and can generally be fairly painful for your catgirl, so even if 
                you are fairly clumsy and unsure it will be difficult to cause her 
                discomfort or injury.
                <br>Now spent, this is a good time to wipe her vagina of the 
                accumulated sexual lubrication fluids she has produced in abundance. 
                You may notice a scent of salty and slighty sweet. This is normal. 
                She may shake uncontrollably if you wipe her with too much pressure, 
                so be gentle!</p>
                
                <p>She's had an exhausting run! Stroke her hair gently and talk 
                encouragingly to her. This is a time of extremes of emotion, stress 
                and agitation for your catgirl. Please be supportive and extra 
                kind to her during this period!
                <br>She may sleep or rest for a bit and likely awake and seek another 
                round of stimulation. The first round is generally the longest, next 
                time or two can usually be brief. At this point it is generally 
                unlikely she will require more attention until the next day. This 
                will depend on your catgirl's personality.</p>
                
                <p>Excercise care bathing her after this as her genitals will likely 
                be a bit puffy, red and very sensitive. If she seeks additional 
                stimulation while bathing you can accomplish relief for her by 
                locating and gently manipulating her clitoris in slow clockwise and 
                counter-clockwise circles. At this point, stimulation of her nipples 
                by fingers or mouth will likely be appreciated. If she indicates she 
                desires manual insertion you may do so at your discretion. Her climax 
                may take a bit and be particularly intense and emotional for her, 
                <em>which may be expressed as crying, sobbing or clutching onto you,</em> 
                but will put her out of commission for a while and you can have a 
                well-deserved break.
                <br>Your catgirl will likely spend the time you have together that day 
                afterwards being especially attentive and affectionate towards you. You 
                may wish to give her a favourite treat or toy to settle her further down. 
                If she "presents" again in the evening, it is the owner's choice whether 
                to indulge her or not if she is not demonstrating distress. This offer 
                for stimulation is most likely a desire to bond further with her master, 
                not a desperate hormone induced plea. It is not a good idea to provide 
                manual stimulation in your bed or sleeping area, lest she come to 
                associate mating with the sleeping arrangements! If you live alone this 
                may not be a problem. If you live with a significant other, they may wery 
                well take that amiss!</p>
