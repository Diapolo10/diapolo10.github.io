                <p>Many people have questions regarding their catgirls, 
                ranging from hilarious mishaps to very bad ideas. The 
                developer(s) of this site decided to address a couple of them!</p>

                <span class="question">
                    <h3>Is my catgirl broken? She keeps staring at me for no apparent reason.</h3>
                </span>
                <p>Don't worry, that's normal! Catgirls often stare at things, 
                both living and inanimate, they are inteerested in. Your 
                catgirl is clearly just curious of your daily routine. 
                This is a good sign, because now you can try bonding with her 
                by inviting her to take a closer look at what you are doing. 
                Unless it's particularly complicated or dangerous, you can 
                even try and get her to join you!</p>
                
                <span class="question">
                    <h3>Can catgirls eat cat food?</h3>
                </span>
                <p>While most catgirls have been taught to eat human food, 
                they can still eat food made for normal cats. However, try 
                to avoid this as she may refuse to eat cat food.</p>
                
                <span class="question">
                    <h3>How long is the average lifespan of a catgirl?</h3>
                </span>
                <p>The catgirl lifespan is heavily dependent on her breed, 
                although most breeds can life for up to 90 years under 
                good care. Some breeds, however, won't live much longer 
                as your average cat.</p>
                
                <span class="question">
                    <h3>My catgirl and I were caught by rain while walking home. Do you think I could help her hair and tail to dry by putting her in a microwave oven for just a little while?</h3>
                </span>
                <p>Your question has led us to believe that you aren't a suitable 
                owner for your catgirl, and have put forward a request for the 
                local police to pay you a visit. Any sane person knows that by 
                putting her in a microwave oven she would die a cruel, painful 
                death. We have put this question on the site to make sure similiar 
                events won't happen in the future, as well as given a word to 
                catgirl breeders to both teach the catgirls not to follow their 
                masters' orders in such situations as well as let the new owners 
                know this is strictly forbidden. No exceptions!</p>
