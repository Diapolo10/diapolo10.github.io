                <h1>Super Mario 64 machinima - The Guide</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>Hey, you have probably heard of people like
                   Supermarioglitchy4, MarioMario54321 and Starman3.
                   What do they have in common? They, and many others, 
                   all make cool videos with a game called Super Mario 64. 
                   "How do they do it?", you may ask. Worry not, this guide 
                   will hopefully answer all of your questions and even 
                   teach you how to make your own!</p>

                <h2>
                    Forewords from the Author
                </h2>
                <p> It might be hard to believe, but this is actually the 
                    second iteration of my guide. The original was a mere
                    blog post on the now-defunct
                    <abbr title="YouTube Rangers">YTR</abbr> Forums, and it
                    was never even close to a finished state. This was years
                    ago, though, and a lot of things have changed since then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I originally started this project when I was still in
                    middle school. The first time I found out about this
                    subgenre of machinima was a year before, in 2010 I believe,
                    coming across SMG4 and MM54321's videos by chance when
                    browsing through YouTube. What I learned then was that
                    videogames could work as a storytelling medium even if 
                    you weren't the original developer yourself. It turned out
                    that all the information regarding how to make such videos
                    myself was scarce at best, though; presumably because
                    people already had experience with producing machinima
                    with other games. Luckily, it wasn't exactly rocket science;
                    in just a week, I had already made my first video. Of course,
                    it was nowhere near the quality I had seen from the others,
                    but it was a start. Slowly and surely, though, I would
                    eventually learn more advanced techniques and tools to help me 
                    reach those goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I came to realise that there still wasn't a single,
                    easy-to-approach guide for the essentials - and a little more
                    than that - to the average machinimist. That's when I decided
                    I'd at least try to do something about it. So the work on this
                    project started. It was never finished, but now with a more
                    accessible approach I'm going to try this again. The guide will
                    retain its original planned shape, with a few additions, and it
                    will also look prettier... eventually. Please be patient, folks!
                </p>

<!-- 1. First steps
The world of SM64 machinima may seem really complicated and difficult at first glance, but do not worry: anyone can learn the basics in a few hours, usually even faster!
This guide will help you through not only the beginning, but will also teach you many commonly used tricks and techniques even the most famous machinimists use quite often - even in machinima made with other games!

1.1. Emulators and emulation
In case you didn't know, we are now able to play old console games on a PC by using emulators, specifically created software that mimic the original console. It's entirely possible to use a real Nintendo 64 to make machinima videos, but since they are starting to become a rare sight and because emulators have some extremely useful features, I very much recommend using an emulator. There are quite a few different N64 emulators to choose from, but this tutorial focuses mainly on Project 64 (ver. 1.6). Feel free to use others such as Mupen 64 instead, if you like!
