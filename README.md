Web testing

## About the project
This is an example website that is being developed without any of your usual fancy frameworks or tools. Everything is simple and understandable HTML5. The goal is to create a scalable site which works on all devices while still looking as nice as possible!

Anyone can contribute on the public branch, but remember - your code needs to be:

* Easy to read (=indent your code properly)
* Simple (=make sure the code is as simple as possible, it needs to be relatively easy to understand)
* Platform-independent (=needs to work on all platforms, except Internet Explorer. Especially important if you use JavaScript, because you need to consider those who might have disabled it!)
* Standard (=follow the HTML5-standard, XHTML is also fine!)

Basically, consider this a great learning opportunity! :)
